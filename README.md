# Social_Network_API_Erin_Mulcahey

## Description

My motivation was to build an API for a social network web application where users could share their thoughts, react to friends' thoughts, and create a friend list. I used Express.js for routing, MongoDB database, and the Mongoose ODM. I wanted to build this application so that a user could have an organized code that can work to easily keep track of their social network friends and thoughts. This solves the problem of not being able to connect different friends together or not having access to know and view the thoughts of those friends. I learned how to build and structure the API, what many social network applications may look like, and how to connect different pieces of data through code.
